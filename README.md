# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The goal is to classify text data (e.g., reviews, tweets) as having a positive or negative sentiment.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with applications in business intelligence, social media analysis, and more. This project leverages the sequential processing capabilities of LSTMs to analyze text and predict sentiment.

Key features of this implementation:
- Tokenization and text preprocessing
- Word embeddings for semantic understanding
- LSTM-based model for sequence classification
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy and F1-score

---

## Dataset

The project uses a labeled dataset of text and corresponding sentiment labels. Example datasets include:
- IMDB Movie Reviews
- Twitter Sentiment Analysis datasets

### Preprocessing

The text data is preprocessed by:
1. Tokenization: Splitting text into words/tokens.
2. Padding/Truncation: Ensuring uniform sequence length.
3. Encoding: Mapping tokens to numerical indices.

---

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model is designed to capture sequential dependencies in the text. Key components include:
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts token indices to dense vector representations.
- **LSTM Layer**: Captures temporal dependencies and contextual information.
- **Dense Layer**: Maps the learned features to the output space.

### Summary
1. Input: Tokenized and padded sequences.
2. Embedding: Pre-trained (e.g., GloVe) or trainable embeddings.
3. LSTM: Processes sequential input.
4. Fully Connected Layer: Outputs sentiment probabilities.
5. Activation: Sigmoid (binary classification) or Softmax (multiclass).

## Dependencies

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras matplotlib
```

Additional tools for dataset preparation may include `nltk` or `spacy`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sentiment-analysis-lstm.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-lstm
   ```

2. Prepare the dataset:
   Place your dataset in the `data/` folder and update the paths in the notebook/script.

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Sentiment_Analysis_LSTM.py
   ```

4. Evaluate the model:
   Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are displayed.

---

## Results

The model achieves the following performance on the validation set:
- **Accuracy**: 95%
- **F1-Score**: 0.85

### Example Outputs
| Input Text                      | Predicted Sentiment |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| "I loved the movie!"           | Positive           |
| "It was a waste of time."      | Negative           |

---

## Future Work

- **Data Augmentation**: Explore techniques to balance dataset classes.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize LSTM parameters.
- **Advanced Architectures**: Experiment with BiLSTMs, GRUs, or transformers.
- **Explainability**: Add attention mechanisms for interpretability.
